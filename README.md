Extremely simple SDL2 project showing triangle, circle and rectangle. To build the project, just download SDL2 (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) and SDL2_ttf (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases) and put them into SDL2GeometricPrimitives/SDL2GeometricPrimitives/tools/SDL2 and SDL2GeometricPrimitives/SDL2GeometricPrimitives/tools/SDL2_ttf accordingly. You can also download tools.7z from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JpMyFuhVXX4SZeM2pOE8HZ1ztdW0UTHg/view?usp=sharing (SDL2-2.28.2, SDL2_ttf-2.20.2 used).
To run build, either put both SDL2.dll and SDL2_ttf.dll near SDL2GeometricPrimitives.exe, or add pathes to these libraries to the $PATH variable.
